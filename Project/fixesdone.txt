================================================================================

## 1. Restored Visitor Counter Pill UI
   Status: ✅ Implemented
   Description: Re-implemented the grey pill-shaped container layout from the 
   old code, placing the "Visitor Count" text on the left and the "Support" 
   button on the right side-by-side.
   Complex Wording: "Reconstructed the visitor metrics container using a 
   pill-morphic layout paradigm for enhanced visual grouping."

## 2. Back-to-Top Button Perfection
   Status: ✅ Implemented
   Description: Updated the CSS with specific values (line-height: 1.2, 
   font-size: 1.9rem) to ensure the emoji is perfectly centered within 
   the circle on every page.
   Complex Wording: "Achieved pixel-perfect vertical centering of navigation 
   glyphs using refined line-height ratios."

## 3. Dynamic Footer Address & Phone
   Status: ✅ Implemented
   Description: Implemented a script to universally replace the footer address 
   with "Suprapa High School Road..." and the fixed phone number +91-9876543210 
   across all pages.
   Complex Wording: "Deployed a centralized content injection system for 
   consistent institutional branding across all page footers."

## 4. Dynamic Upcoming Event Dates
   Status: ✅ Implemented
   Description: Removed hardcoded event dates and added logic to automatically 
   set them relative to the current date (e.g., Today + 5 days), ensuring they 
   always appear current.
   Complex Wording: "Implemented temporal offset algorithms for event date 
   generation, ensuring perpetual content freshness."

## 5. Enhanced Newsletter Feedback
   Status: ✅ Implemented
   Description: Updated the subscription interaction to show a "Subscribing..." 
   loading state on the button with a temporary delay before displaying the 
   "Thank you" tooltip.
   Complex Wording: "Integrated asynchronous feedback loops with loading state 
   indicators to enhance user interaction acknowledgment."

## 6. Copyright & Date UI Polish
   Status: ✅ Implemented
   Description: Restored the specific icons (©, 🕒, 👨‍💻) for the copyright 
   section and ensured the "Last Updated" date displays the current dynamic 
   date instead of a static one.
   Complex Wording: "Implemented real-time timestamp rendering for copyright 
   metadata with semantic iconography."

## 7. Social Media Comments UI
   Status: ✅ Implemented
   Description: Completely revamped the social media feed. It now generates 
   proper "cards" with SVG icons for Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. The 
   design is cleaner, with a consistent white background, subtle shadows, 
   and defined borders.
   Complex Wording: "Architected a component-based social feed system with 
   platform-specific SVG iconography and elevated card surfaces."

## 8. Newsletter Logic Linked
   Status: ✅ Implemented
   Description: Found the script responsible for the footer newsletter and 
   upgraded it. It now detects both the upper "Stay Updated" form and the 
   footer form. Submitting either form acts exactly the same.
   Complex Wording: "Unified form submission handlers across multiple DOM 
   instances to ensure behavioral consistency."

## 9. Faculty Section Alignment (Dark Mode)
   Status: ✅ Implemented
   Description: Applied a fix to the dark mode styling for the "Our 
   Distinguished Faculty" section. It now stays perfectly centered, 
   maintaining the same width and layout as the light mode version.
   Complex Wording: "Resolved thematic layout drift in dark mode by enforcing 
   consistent box-model constraints."

## 10. Header Standardization & Contextualization
   Status: ✅ Implemented
   Description: Unified the header design across all 20+ webpages to match 
   the Homepage standard, while implementing dynamic titles (e.g., "School 
   Gallery", "Contact Us") for better page context.
   Complex Wording: "Established a global header template with contextual 
   title injection for improved information architecture."

## 11. Footer Standardization
   Status: ✅ Implemented
   Description: Batch-updated footer sections across the entire site to 
   ensure the Newsletter form, Visitor Counter, and Weather Widget are 
   consistently available on every page.
   Complex Wording: "Deployed a standardized footer component across the 
   entire site matrix for feature parity."

## 12. Enhanced Weather Widget (Dual-Location)
   Status: ✅ Implemented
   Description: Rebuilt the widget to display both School weather and User's 
   local weather simultaneously using a CORS-friendly IP service (ipwho.is) 
   for reliable detection.
   Complex Wording: "Integrated a dual-source geolocation weather API with 
   CORS-compliant IP resolution for localized data aggregation."

## 13. Weather Widget UI & Cache Optimization
   Status: ✅ Implemented
   Description: Implemented a Flexbox layout for alignment, removed hardcoded 
   colors for Light/Dark mode compatibility, and added a 3-hour caching 
   system to optimize performance.
   Complex Wording: "Optimized weather data retrieval with temporal caching 
   strategies and adaptive chromatic theming."

## 14. Notice Board Revamp
   Status: ✅ Implemented
   Description: Transformed the static notice board into a dynamic interface 
   featuring a "New" items marquee, auto-expiring content, and a modal popup 
   system for viewing details.
   Complex Wording: "Engineered a dynamic announcement system with temporal 
   content expiration and modal-based detail views."

## 15. Exam Schedule Modernization
   Status: ✅ Implemented
   Description: Refactored the Exam Schedule page to use dynamic date 
   generation for tables, ensuring dates automatically stay current without 
   manual HTML edits.
   Complex Wording: "Implemented algorithmic date population for examination 
   schedules, eliminating static content dependencies."

## 16. Gallery & Special Page Fixes
   Status: ✅ Implemented
   Description: Manually replaced non-standard "simplified headers" in 
   Gallery, Contact Us, and Virtual Tour pages to strictly enforce the 
   global design identity.
   Complex Wording: "Enforced design system compliance across auxiliary pages 
   through manual template remediation."

## 17. Viewport Navigation Fluid Dynamics
   Status: ✅ Implemented
   The Fix: Enable smooth scrolling globally.
   Code: html { scroll-behavior: smooth; }
